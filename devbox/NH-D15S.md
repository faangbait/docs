## Notes: 
- Noctua uses NSPR = ( heat-load 1 / (t-case - t-ambient) ) * 10 + ( heat-load 2 / 10 )
- NH-D15S chromax-black has an NSPR of 167

## Changelog
- 2022-Apr: In CPU-intensive benchmarks, I'm routinely pegging the CPU thermal limit at 100C. While this isn't a problem and is within Intel's specs, I'm considering lowering the thermal limit to 95C so that my motherboard starts backing off on voltage a bit earlier. On the other hand, I'm not sure if this would have any tangible benefits.
- 2022-Mar: Initial install.
